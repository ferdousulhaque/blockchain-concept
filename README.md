# Blockchain Proof of Concept

This project is for the blockchain proof of concept using Javascript. There are few components of a blockchain technology and I tried to write pseudo codes to generate that.

## Components
I have declared an interface to declare the main components, so any blockchain technology must adhere to the contracts

1. Generate Hash
2. Last Processed Block
3. Proof of work
4. Mining
5. Append to the Blockchain


## Use Cases for blockchain

- Library
- Car Rental Application
- Payment Systems (Bitcoin)
- Asset Tracking (Laptops)
- Identity Information (National IDs)
